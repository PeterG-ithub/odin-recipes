        <ol>
            <li>Peel the ripe banana and break it into chunks.</li>

            <li>In a blender, combine the banana chunks, fresh spinach leaves, almond 
            butter or peanut butter, Greek yogurt, and almond milk.</li>

            <li>If desired, add honey or maple syrup for a touch of sweetness. This 
            step is optional, as the sweetness of the banana and flavored yogurt 
            may be sufficient for your taste.</li>

            <li>Blend all the ingredients together until smooth and creamy. If you prefer 
            a thicker consistency, you can add more yogurt or reduce the amount of milk. 
            If you prefer a thinner consistency, add a little more milk.</li>

            <li>If you'd like a chilled smoothie, add a handful of ice cubes to the blender 
            and blend again until the ice is crushed and well incorporated.</li>

            <li>Once the smoothie reaches your desired consistency, pour it into a glass.</li>

            <li>You can garnish the smoothie with a sprinkle of chia seeds, sliced almonds, 
            or a drizzle of honey for added texture and flavor.</li>

            <li>Thor's Thundering Smoothie is now ready to be enjoyed! Sip on this powerful 
            blend of banana, spinach, nut butter, and yogurt to feel energized and ready 
            to take on the day, just like the mighty Thor himself.</li>
