        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A protein-packed omelet made with eggs, smoked salmon, mushrooms, and a variety of 
            herbs and spices. This savory dish would fortify me and awaken my taste buds.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 ounces smoked salmon, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh herbs (such as dill, chives, or parsley)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Butter or cooking oil for the pan</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them until well beaten. 
                Season with salt and pepper according to your taste preferences. Set aside.</li>

            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add a small amount of butter 
                or cooking oil to coat the pan.</li>
            
            <li>Once the pan is heated, add the sliced mushrooms and saut√© them for a few 
                minutes until they become tender and slightly browned.</li>
            
            <li>Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet, swirling them around to evenly 
                distribute them. Let the eggs cook undisturbed for a minute or until the 
                edges start to set.</li>
            
            <li>Gently lift the edges of the omelet with a spatula and tilt the pan to 
                allow the uncooked egg mixture to flow to the edges. Repeat this process 
                until the omelet is mostly cooked but still slightly runny on top.</li>
            
            <li>Arrange the smoked salmon slices on one half of the omelet, followed by 
                the chopped fresh herbs.</li>
            
            <li>Carefully fold the other half of the omelet over the salmon and herbs to 
                create a half-moon shape. Press it down gently with the spatula.</li>
            
            <li>Cook the omelet for another minute or until the eggs are fully set and 
                the salmon is warmed through. You can flip it over if desired to ensure 
                even cooking, but it's not necessary.</li>
           
            <li>Once the omelet is cooked to your liking, slide it onto a plate. Cut it 
                in half or into smaller portions, if desired, for easier serving.</li>
        </ol>
