        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A slice of hearty, whole-grain bread toasted to perfection and spread 
            with a generous layer of almond butter, topped with sliced apples, a 
            sprinkle of cinnamon, and a drizzle of honey.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Slices of your favorite bread (such as whole grain, sourdough, 
                or gluten-free)</li>
            <li>Almond butter or any nut butter of your choice</li>
            <li>Sliced apples</li>
            <li>Ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>Honey or maple syrup for drizzling</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Toast the bread slices to your desired level of crispness.</li>

            <li>Once the bread is toasted, spread a generous amount of almond butter 
            or your preferred nut butter on each slice. You can adjust the amount 
            based on your preference for nutty flavor.</li>

            <li>Place thinly sliced apples on top of the nut butter. You can arrange 
            them in a neat pattern or overlap them for a more artistic touch.</li>

            <li>Sprinkle a pinch of ground cinnamon over the apple slices. The warmth 
            and aroma of cinnamon will complement the flavors of the toast.</li>

            <li>If desired, drizzle a small amount of honey or maple syrup over the toast. 
            This will add a touch of sweetness and balance out the flavors.</li>

            <li>Serve Loki's Trickster Toast immediately and enjoy the playful combination 
            of creamy nut butter, crisp apples, and warm cinnamon flavors.</li>
